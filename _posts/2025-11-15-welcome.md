Hey, I'm Graeme — welcome to my portfolio website!

Feel free to explore and learn more about me and my intentions as I transition into a new data role.

As I write this on Saturday 15th November, I’m only a couple of days into my learning journey following a short break after leaving my previous role. That’s why the site is still a little sparse in terms of completed work, but that will change quickly.

Work is already underway on my first portfolio project, which will involve setting up new and existing datasets in Azure, mirroring them across Fabric, and bringing everything together in Power BI to create an insightful dashboard. It’s a fairly simple starting point, but one that demonstrates solid end-to-end skills.

As time goes on, I’ll increase the complexity of my work to layer in new skills, tools, and techniques as I learn them.

Finally, a quick note about the website itself — it may be quite minimal, but there’s a reason for that. One of my goals is to improve my hands-on understanding of GitHub. Although I’ve used GitHub for years while overseeing a Software Engineering team, I was never deeply involved in the day-to-day. Since Git appears frequently in data role descriptions, building this site with GitHub Pages felt like the perfect way to dive deeper and get more comfortable with it.
